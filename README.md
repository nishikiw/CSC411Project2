# DeepNeuralNetwork

The goal of this project is to create deep learning network to recognize 1) handwritten digits (from the famous MINST dataset), and 2) faces of different actors.

Some of the topics explored in part 1 include:

1. Implementing a multi-layer neural network.
2. Multinomial logistical regression.
3. Gradient Vectorization.

Some of the topics explored in part 2 include:

1. Multinomial logsitic regression.
2. Backpropagation.
3. Regularization.
4. Visualizing hidden unit.
